If you find any errors, please report them to us in writing.\n\n\nI. Overview\n\n\nWelcome to the 7-CONNECT Merchant Integration Guide.\n\n\n7-CONNECT is 7-Eleven's platform for e-commerce businesses that enables cash payment convenience for your customers. Customers will be able to pay for online purchases at any 7-Eleven store.\n\n\n7-CONNECT features the following:\n\n\n\n\n24/7  cash payment at all 7-Eleven stores\n\n\nIncreases your market beyond credit card holders\n\n\nEasier and faster than bank deposits\n\n\nZero risk of fraud and chargebacks\n\n\nReal time notification of payment to your transaction systems\n\n\n\n\nAs a merchant, you will have access to new customers who do not have credit cards or who refuse to use them online. This opens up opportunities for you. There are no chargebacks or fraud to worry about. All completed transactions are guaranteed to be remitted to you.\n\n\nII. Getting Started\n\n\nThis guide assumes you have a working knowledge of the following:\n\n\n\n\nHTTP and webservice concepts\n\n\nSHA-1 hashing\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating your website to 7-CONNECT will require development of two points:\n\n\n\n\n7-CONNECT Reference Request: You will need to request for a 7-CONNECT Reference which will be used by customers to pay at the store.\n\n\nMerchant Payment API: This URL will enable 7-Connect to notify your system in realtime whenever the customer pays at the store.\n\n\n\n\nThese URLs will be used. Note that each endpoint will have a different transaction key.\n\n\nFor Testing:\n\n\nhttps://testpay.cliqq.net/transact\n\n\n\n\nFor Live Production\n\n\nhttps://pay.7-eleven.com.ph/transact\n\n\n\n\nTo get the latest information and graphic logos, please visit the site: \nhttp://7-connect.philseven.com\n\n\nIII. 7-Connect Web Services\n\n\nA. 7-Connect Reference\n\n\n7-Connect Reference is a 12-digit number issued by the 7-Connect gateway. This reference number will be presented at the store in order to transact customer's purchase under 7-Connect.\n\n\n1. Creating a payment reference\n\n\na.) Via a redirect page \u2013\n After customer checks out and chooses 7-Connect as a payment option, merchant will send a request to generate a reference number. They will be then automatically redirected to the payment instruction page. This means that merchants don't have to create a payment instruction page.  The payment instruction page contains the transaction details and the 7-Connect reference number issued for the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Customer selects \n7-CONNECT\n as Payment Mode in Checkout.\n\n  \n Merchant Site sends a 7-CONNECT Reference Request to the 7-CONNECT Gateway.\n\n  \n 7-CONNECT Gateway displays the following instruction page displaying the Merchant details and the 7-CONNECT Reference.  At this point, the Customer can:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. Write down the 7-CONNECT Reference\n b. Print the page\n\n\n  \n Customer selects \nContinue Browsing\n.\n\n  \n 7-CONNECT Gateway redirects to the Merchant's Success URL.\n\n  \n Merchant Site displays the Order Confirmation page.\n\n \n\n\n\n\na.1) Request Parameters\n\n\nUsing HTTP Post or Get, the merchant site has to provide the 7-CONNECT Gateway with    the parameters it requires to generate a 7-CONNECT Reference.  You will be provided with your own Merchant ID and Transaction Key after completing the merchant agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nRequired?\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmerchantID\n\n\nText (15)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nMerchant's ID as provided by 7-CONNECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmerchantRef\n\n\nText (40)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nMerchant's Reference Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\namount\n\n\nNumber (12, 2)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nTransaction amount.\nFormat: XXXXXXXXXX.XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpDate\n\n\nNumber (14)\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nTransaction's expiration date/time.\nFormat: yyyyMMddHHmmss\nIf not specified, blank or malformed, the expiry date is set to the value defined in the merchant settings which is 2880 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuccessURL\n\n\nText (300)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nThe page to which 7-CONNECT redirects to after the user clicks on the Continue Browsing button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfailURL\n\n\nText (300)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nThe page to which 7-CONNECT redirects to after a failed transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken\n\n\nText\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nTransaction Security Token\nTo create this, get the SHA-1 digest of:\nmerchantID + merchantRef + {transactionKey}\nPHP code:\n*$token = sha1($merchantID . $merchantRef .

Creation of payment reference over a web service \u2013\n This allows more control on how payment instruction should be delivered to customers. Merchant will be the one responsible to display the payment instructions with the 7-Connect Reference Number. This is a web service that receives an HTTP POST request and returns a JSON response. Sends the specified data in a POST request to  the  HTTP server,  in  the  same  way  that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n\n\n\n\nb.1) Request Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nRequired?\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmerchantID\n\n\nText (15)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nMerchant's ID as provided by 7-CONNECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmerchantRef\n\n\nText (40)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nMerchant's Reference Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\namount\n\n\nNumber (12, 2)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nTransaction amount.\nFormat: XXXXXXXXXX.XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpDate\n\n\nNumber (14)\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nTransaction's expiration date/time.\nFormat: yyyyMMddHHmmss\nIf not specified, blank or malformed, the expiry date is set to the value defined in the merchant settings which is 2880 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuccessURL\n\n\nText (300)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nThe page to which 7-CONNECT redirects to after the user clicks on the Continue Browsing button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfailURL\n\n\nText (300)\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nThe page to which 7-CONNECT redirects to after a failed transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken\n\n\nText\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nTransaction Security Token\nTo create this, get the SHA-1 digest of:\nmerchantID + merchantRef + {transactionKey}\nPHP code:\n$token = sha1($merchantID . $merchantRef .

Merchant Web Services (Webhooks)\n\n\nA. Handling Payments\n\n\nMerchants should prepare a Payment Handler to process payment postings that were paid at the store. When a POS payment event is triggered, we\u2019ll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook\u2019s configured URL. Your Payment Handler will then proceed to fulfill the customer's order by updating transaction records or balances and sending a voucher or e-ticket by email or SMS to the customer.\n\n\n\n\n7-CONNECT requires its merchants to have the following web services:\n\n\n\n\nVALIDATE (mandatory)\n\n\n\n\nThis is used to verify the validity of a given Merchant Reference Number.\n\n\n\n\nCONFIRM (mandatory)\n\n\n\n\nThis is used to void the payment made to a given Merchant Reference Number.\n\n\n\n\nCommunication will be done using \nHTTP Post\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

This reference number will be presented at the store in order to transact customer's purchase under 7-Connect.  1. Creating a payment reference  a.) Via a redirect page \u2013  After customer checks out and chooses 7-Connect as a payment option, merchant will send a request to generate a reference number. They will be then automatically redirected to the payment instruction page. This means that merchants don't have to create a payment instruction page.  The payment instruction page contains the transaction details and the 7-Connect reference number issued for the transaction.     \n    Customer selects  7-CONNECT  as Payment Mode in Checkout. \n    Merchant Site sends a 7-CONNECT Reference Request to the 7-CONNECT Gateway. \n    7-CONNECT Gateway displays the following instruction page displaying the Merchant details and the 7-CONNECT Reference.  At this point, the Customer can:       a. Write down the 7-CONNECT Reference  b. Print the page \n    Customer selects  Continue Browsing . \n    7-CONNECT Gateway redirects to the Merchant's Success URL. \n    Merchant Site displays the Order Confirmation page. \n    a.1) Request Parameters  Using HTTP Post or Get, the merchant site has to provide the 7-CONNECT Gateway with    the parameters it requires to generate a 7-CONNECT Reference.  You will be provided with your own Merchant ID and Transaction Key after completing the merchant agreement.     Name  Data Type  Required?

Required if service is available through CLiQQ  This field can be set to other relevant transaction information that will be passed to the merchant's postback URL (e.g. Account Number, Customer Contact Number, etc.). This field is needed since the 7\u00adConnect reference number may be generated by another device. That device will generate the payLoad contents and the payLoad contents will then be passed to the merchant's postback URL upon transaction payment.  If merchant plans to integrate with CLiQQ, this will be  REQUIRED.  This will contain details of the transaction provided by the customer.    returnPaymentDetails  Text (1)  Optional  Value can either be Y or N or blank.

Creation of payment reference over a web service \u2013  This allows more control on how payment instruction should be delivered to customers. Merchant will be the one responsible to display the payment instructions with the 7-Connect Reference Number. This is a web service that receives an HTTP POST request and returns a JSON response. Sends the specified data in a POST request to  the  HTTP server,  in  the  same  way  that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.   b.1) Request Parameters     Name  Data Type  Required?
